# PropertyInvesting.com Homepage Redesign Project

## Project Context

This is an experimental React project for testing alternative homepage layouts for PropertyInvesting.com (PI), an Australia-based property investment education community.

**About PropertyInvesting.com:**
- 20+ year-old community centered around property investment education
- Primary audience: Australians interested in property investing (both seasoned and tentative investors)
- Core features: Forum, training courses, seminars, community interaction
- Current objective: Turn visitors into repeat interactors
- Revenue model: Course/seminar sales driven by publicity and mailing list

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 18+ with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (preferred for rapid prototyping)
- **Icons**: lucide-react or heroicons
- **No backend required**: Static demo pages with mock data

## Design Goals

1. **Conversion-focused**: Design should encourage visitor engagement and repeat visits
2. **Trust signals**: Showcase 20+ years of credibility, community size, success stories
3. **Clear value proposition**: Make it immediately obvious what PI offers
4. **Community feel**: Highlight forum activity, member testimonials, interaction
5. **Professional yet approachable**: Balance authority with accessibility
6. **Mobile-first**: Fully responsive design

## Key Elements to Experiment With

- Hero section variations (video backgrounds, testimonials, stats)
- Forum preview/activity feed positioning
- Course/seminar showcase approaches
- Call-to-action placement and messaging
- Navigation patterns (sticky, mega menu, simple)
- Social proof integration (member count, testimonials, recent activity)
- Value proposition clarity
- Trust indicators (years in business, success metrics)

## Development Standards

### Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components under 150 lines; split if larger
- One component per file
- Use descriptive, semantic component names

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript or JSX (TypeScript preferred)
- Destructure props at component top
- Use meaningful variable names (no single letters except loop counters)
- Add brief comments for complex logic

### Mock Data
- Create realistic mock data for forum posts, testimonials, courses
- Use Australian context (locations, dollar amounts, terminology)
- Include realistic timestamps, member names, engagement metrics

### Performance
- Lazy load images
- Use semantic HTML (header, nav, main, article, section)
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals

## Demo Site Requirements

1. **Multiple Layout Variants**: Create 2-3 distinct homepage approaches to compare
2. **Navigation Between Variants**: Simple menu to switch between layouts
3. **Responsive**: Must work beautifully on mobile, tablet, desktop
4. **Polish**: Production-quality visuals, not wireframes
5. **Interactive Elements**: Hover states, smooth transitions, working links (even if they go nowhere)
6. **Accessibility**: Proper contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation

## Content Guidelines

- Use Australian English spelling (e.g., "centre" not "center")
- Tone: Knowledgeable but friendly, experienced but not condescending
- Focus on outcomes: "Build wealth through property" vs "Learn about property investing"
- Emphasize community and proven track record

## What Good Looks Like

✅ Clean, modern layouts that feel 2024+ (avoid dated forum aesthetics)
✅ Clear hierarchy and visual flow guiding visitors to key actions
✅ Balanced use of white space
✅ Strategic use of color (Australian investment context suggests trust colors like blue/green)
✅ Fast loading, smooth interactions
✅ Realistic, compelling copy and mock content

❌ Generic template look
❌ Cluttered information-dense designs
❌ Unclear calls-to-action
❌ Poor mobile experience
❌ Lorem ipsum placeholder text

## Quick Start Commands

When setting up the project, suggest:
```bash
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer lucide-react
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

## Priority Focus

When creating demos, prioritize:
1. **Above-the-fold impact**: First impression is critical
2. **Clear value proposition**: Visitor should understand PI in 3 seconds
3. **Conversion pathways**: Multiple clear CTAs for engagement
4. **Trust building**: Showcase credibility immediately
5. **Community visibility**: Make the active forum obvious

**Remember**: This is a demo to test ideas. Focus on visual design and layout experimentation, not complex functionality. The goal is to find layouts that better convert visitors into repeat interactors.
