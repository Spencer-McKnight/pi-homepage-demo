[PropertyInvesting.com](http://PropertyInvesting.com) (PI) is an Australia-based monetised investment community created by Steve McKnight (Owner) and team to deliver a range of value for seasoned or tentative investors interested in property. The project was created initially to foster a space where Steve could share his wealth of knowledge, advise, and interact with the community.

The site has historically been primarily a forum that funnels into purchased training courses and seminars. Other projects have been launched with PI as a base, such as Money Magnet, from 0 to 130++ properties series, his US-based property fund, and most recently SOGIF his venture with Paul Harper managing property funds to bring reliable portfolio returns to Australians.

Most of the ongoing revenue for PI is generated through sales for courses and seminars, which are largely purchased following publicity initiatives by Steve or utilising a vast user mailing list.

With the user base of personal-insight hungry and opinionated seasoned investors, and a target market of Australians who want to learn about investing in property, PI has delivered value for 20+ years through the forum at its heart and educational publications. The current objective is to turn visitors into repeat interactors.
